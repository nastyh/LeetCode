        Array List has indexes and could provide Insert and GetRandom in average constant time, though has problems with Delete.
        To delete a value at arbitrary index takes linear time. The solution here is to always delete the last value:

        Swap the element to delete with the last one.

        Pop the last element out.
        For that, one has to compute an index of each element in constant time, and hence needs a hashmap which stores element -> its index dictionary.
