        O(n!) permutations by exploring all possible ways to arrange a set of numbers
        Real time is faster due to early pruning in backtracking 
        O(n) due to the backtracking stack

         Try to place larger numbers first.
         To achieve this is to iterate from n down to 1 when deciding which number to put in an empty slot.
         For i â‰¥ 2 you try to place i at a position pos and then again at pos + i (provided both positions are free).
         For i = 1, since it only occurs once, you simply place it in one free slot.
