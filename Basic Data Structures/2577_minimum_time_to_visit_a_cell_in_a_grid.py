        neighboring cells are inaccessible, with higher minimum times.
        In such situations, we must "waste" time to move forward. We can move back and forth between
        the current cell and any previously accessible cells until a neighboring cell becomes accessible.
        Itâ€™s important to note that each unit of time wasted takes 2 seconds since we travel
        to a previous cell and return to the current cell. Therefore, if the difference between the current
        time and the target cell's time is odd, we can step into the target cell exactly when it becomes accessible.
